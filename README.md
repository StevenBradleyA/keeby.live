<!-- Keeby Notes

 - auction system
  - email notifications when a user is outbid
  - in app notification when a user is outbid, wins an auction.

  - need to figure out a payment plan
 - Seller ratings and reviews. public feedback system
 - requiring the detailed product listings helps buyers make informed decisions

 Escrow Service holds the payment from the buyer until the product is delivered and inspected by the buyer. If the product
 matches the descriptiion, the payment is released to the seller. If there are issues, the funds can be refunded to the buyer.

  implement return policy

  If seller is highly rated can skip verification


  I don't wanna be the middle man
  I don't wanna care about shit if something goes wrong. if there is a problem you pay me. I don't care
  cleanest big dick way to deal with seller gets charged and buyer gets charged. It is up to the community to play by the rules
  You don't sell the keyboard you get fined
  Have to BD energy scamming is not tolerated. This is a mutual party agreement. I will not tolerate dealing with scams. Both will be charged the full price of the keyboard.
  Have to run a transaction on both to process fees before shipment. I hope this never happens but it forces people to play by the rules.
  7 day dispute windown no returns
  Buyer communication is key trusting their commity public ratings

 $1 transaction fee for listing
 %3 or 5% fee

  contractual agreement.

  Ask dad about this


User profiles will have to be clickable
star rating and reviews

Going to need to do a $.50 verification cost for buyers and sellers.


make a keeby video that talks about the rules

Fun yet threatening. See this cyberboard someone sent a buyer a box of tissues instead of an alice and they both had to play.
I don't have the time nor care to deal with disputes so play by the rules and trust one another or you can fuck off. :D
Basically a skycorp video

---user ----
purchase history with order number #
going to need some stripe payment info
 - going to need a ispaymentverified on here
 - going to need a email verified as well

Home page will be typing game with banner ads
really clean UI like monkey type
TYPING GAME ------------------------------------------------
- anti copy paste idk gonna look into anticheat

Going to want to switch between speed mode - quote mode - learn mode (learn about mechanical keyboards?  ) - hackerman mode

(vocabulary enhancement option later gives terms and definitiions )
(maybe change quote length or nah?)

what metrics do we want to show? Top WPM with keyboard...
Stats button pulls down a graph with all your top speed wpm plotted on a graph

Typing game should defo have a rank based on the top percentage of users
- average of top ten fastest
- get a tag
-badge system
-later on season (implementation)
- could either do season 1 hackerman tag
(unranked till you typed 10 times)
HotSwap Hero



---
thock god (top .2%)
Hackerman(0.1%)
based off of top wpm?

How keeby works? or About Keeby?

What's unique about keeby typing game?

ranking system keyboard based.( can see others wpm and keeb)


---------- later   -----------

 --- only if yt pops off ---
Keeby merch  - clothing - keycaps - deskmats
could legit just be a link to anohter site I make later if I want to
store page

Could add a community page where users can submit picuters and talk about their builds

r/mk already exists

Could just have an inspiration page that shows gorgeous builds

Leaderboards

If successful ideas
KEEB SHARE - a community page with cards like arbnb where people can share builds for inspiration

Store
- sell merch - maybe develop a keyboard - maybe make a marketplace that shows products from other sites and links to them

Add achievements - allow people to select tags - their rank or when they buy a keyboard they get a tag etc.
